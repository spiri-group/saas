Seeking connection with loved ones who have passed is deeply personal. Whether you're grieving, looking for closure, or simply curious about what lies beyond, finding the right medium matters. The wrong experience can leave you feeling exploited or disappointed. The right one can offer profound comfort and insight.

Here's how to navigate your search.

## What Mediums Actually Do

Before looking for a medium, understand what you're seeking:

**Mediums** communicate with those who have passed. They serve as intermediaries, receiving and relaying messages from spirit.

**Psychics** read energy and offer insight about your life, past, present, or future—similar to [what you'd experience in a tarot reading](/blog/what-to-expect-first-tarot-reading). Many mediums are also psychic, but not all psychics are mediums.

**Channelers** allow spirits to speak through them, sometimes entering altered states. This is a specific type of mediumship.

If your goal is connecting with someone who has passed, you specifically want a medium—though many practitioners offer multiple services.

## What to Look For

### Credentials and Training

Mediumship isn't regulated, so anyone can claim the title. Look for:

**Formal training**: Many reputable mediums have studied at spiritualist churches, development circles, or with established teachers. Ask about their background.

**Ongoing development**: The best mediums continue refining their abilities. They attend workshops, sit in development circles, and take their craft seriously.

**Professional affiliations**: Membership in organizations like spiritualist churches or professional medium associations suggests commitment to ethical standards.

### Evidence-Based Reading Style

Skilled mediums provide **evidence**—specific details that validate they're connected to your loved one:

- Physical descriptions
- Personality traits
- Specific memories or shared experiences
- Names, dates, or significant numbers
- Details about how they passed
- Information the medium couldn't have researched

A medium who offers only vague statements like "I sense a grandfather figure who loves you" without specific evidence may not have a genuine connection.

### Ethics and Boundaries

Professional mediums maintain clear boundaries:

- They don't diagnose medical conditions or advise against medical treatment
- They don't predict death or create fear
- They don't guarantee specific spirits will come through
- They're transparent about pricing with no hidden upsells
- They acknowledge when connections aren't strong

### Reviews and Testimonials

What do previous clients say? Look for:

- Specific mentions of accurate evidence provided
- Comments about the medium's demeanor and professionalism
- Whether clients felt comforted or exploited
- Return clients (people who've come back multiple times often indicate trust)

## Questions to Ask Before Booking

Don't hesitate to reach out before committing. A professional will welcome your questions:

**"How do you work?"** Understanding their process helps you know what to expect.

**"What kind of evidence do you typically provide?"** This reveals whether they prioritize validation.

**"What if no one comes through?"** Ethical mediums acknowledge this possibility and have policies for it.

**"What's included in the session price?"** Ensures no surprise charges.

**"What's your background and training?"** Legitimate mediums are happy to share their journey.

**"Do you record sessions or can I?"** Having a recording helps you process the reading later.

## Red Flags to Watch For

Some warning signs are obvious. Others are subtle. Be cautious if a medium:

### Makes Fear-Based Claims
- "Your loved one is trapped and I need to help release them"
- "There's a curse on your family"
- "Bad things will happen if you don't continue working with me"

### Requires Additional Payments
- Unexpected fees for "deeper connections" or "special work"
- Pressure to buy candles, crystals, or other items to "help the process"
- Claims that regular sessions are necessary to keep spirits "happy"

### Does Excessive Research
- Asks many leading questions before providing information
- Seems to know things that could be found on social media
- Provides information that's accurate but publicly available

### Can't Accept Uncertainty
- Never says "I'm not sure" or "I'm not getting a clear connection"
- Claims 100% accuracy
- Gets defensive when evidence doesn't resonate

### Creates Dependency
- Insists you need regular sessions
- Suggests you can't make decisions without consulting them
- Discourages you from developing your own intuition

## What to Expect in a Session

Every medium works differently, but sessions typically include:

**Opening**: The medium may explain their process, say a prayer, or take a moment to attune.

**Connection**: They'll begin describing who is coming through, often starting with evidence to validate the connection.

**Messages**: Once validated, they'll share what your loved one wants to communicate.

**Your participation**: You'll confirm or deny evidence (a simple yes/no helps without leading the medium).

**Closing**: Summary of messages, any guidance offered, and ending of the session.

A good reading leaves you feeling lighter, comforted, or at peace—even if emotions arise during the session. You should feel heard and respected throughout.

## Managing Expectations

Even the best mediums:

- Can't guarantee who will come through
- May receive symbols they interpret imperfectly
- Have sessions that are stronger than others
- Can't answer every question you have

Come with openness rather than a checklist of demands. The most meaningful connections often bring unexpected messages.

## After Your Session

### Processing the Experience

Grief and spirit communication stir deep emotions. After your session:

- Give yourself space to feel whatever arises
- Listen to your recording or review notes after a few days—you'll often notice details you missed
- Journal about what resonated and what questions remain
- Be patient with information that didn't immediately make sense—it sometimes clicks later

### If Something Felt Wrong

Trust your instincts. If you felt manipulated, pressured, or that the reading was inauthentic:

- You're not obligated to return
- Consider sharing your experience in reviews to help others
- Don't let one bad experience close you to genuine connection—there are ethical mediums out there
