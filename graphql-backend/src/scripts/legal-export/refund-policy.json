  "content": "# SpiriVerse Refund & Returns Policy\r\n\r\n**Effective Date:** [EFFECTIVE_DATE]\r\n\r\nSpiriVerse is a marketplace that connects buyers with independent partners (each, a \"Partner\"). A \"Partner\" is any individual or business that lists services, products, or experiences on SpiriVerse. offering spiritual products, services, events, and digital content across Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. This Refund & Returns Policy outlines the rules governing refunds, returns, cancellations, and dispute resolution for transactions made through the SpiriVerse platform.\r\n\r\nNothing in this policy limits or excludes any statutory rights you may have under applicable consumer protection laws, including the Australian Consumer Law, the UK Consumer Rights Act 2015, or relevant US state consumer protection statutes.

Each partner may set their own refund terms within the framework established by this policy. The following principles apply to all transactions:\r\n\r\n- **Partner-specific policies are displayed at checkout.** Before completing a purchase, you will see the applicable refund or cancellation policy set by the partner for that specific product, service, or event.\r\n- **Statutory rights are always preserved.** Regardless of any partner-specific policy, your rights under applicable consumer protection law are not affected.\r\n- **Fair resolution is our goal.** SpiriVerse provides a dispute resolution process when buyers and partners cannot reach agreement.\r\n- **Refund eligibility depends on the type of purchase.** Physical products, services, events, and digital content each have different refund rules, detailed in the sections below.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2. Physical Product Returns\r\n\r\nPhysical products sold on SpiriVerse include crystals, candles, tarot decks, jewelry, books, spiritual tools, and similar items.\r\n\r\n### 2.1 Return Eligibility\r\n\r\nYou may request a return or refund for a physical product if:\r\n\r\n- The item arrived damaged, defective, or materially different from its listing description.\r\n- The item was not delivered within the estimated delivery timeframe (allowing reasonable tolerance for shipping delays).\r\n- You are exercising a right of return under the partner's stated return policy.\r\n- You are exercising your statutory rights (see [Section 12](#12-your-statutory-rights)).\r\n\r\n### 2.2 Return Conditions\r\n\r\nTo be eligible for a return under a partner's voluntary return policy:\r\n\r\n- The item must generally be in its original, unused condition unless the item is faulty or not as described.\r\n- Items should be returned in their original packaging where possible.\r\n- You must initiate the return within the timeframe specified in the partner's return policy as displayed at checkout.\r\n\r\n### 2.3 One-of-a-Kind (OOAK) Items\r\n\r\nMany items sold on SpiriVerse are one-of-a-kind (OOAK), such as unique crystals, handmade jewelry, or custom spiritual tools. OOAK items are eligible for refund if they are faulty, damaged in transit, or not as described. Partners may restrict voluntary returns on OOAK items, and any such restriction will be clearly stated on the product listing.\r\n\r\n### 2.4 Backordered Items\r\n\r\nIf you ordered an item on backorder:\r\n\r\n- You will receive an estimated fulfillment date at the time of purchase.\r\n- If the partner cannot fulfill the backorder within a reasonable timeframe, you are entitled to a full refund.\r\n- You may cancel a backorder at any time before the item has shipped and receive a full refund.\r\n\r\n### 2.5 Return Shipping\r\n\r\n- **Faulty, damaged, or not-as-described items:** The partner is responsible for return shipping costs.\r\n- **Change-of-mind returns (where permitted by partner policy):** You are generally responsible for return shipping costs unless the partner's policy states otherwise.\r\n- Return shipping cost estimates are provided during the return process to help you make an informed decision before sending the item back.\r\n\r\n### 2.6 Evidence for Returns\r\n\r\nWhen requesting a return for a damaged, defective, or not-as-described item, you may be asked to upload photos or videos as supporting evidence. This helps partners assess the issue quickly and process your refund without unnecessary delays.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3. Service Cancellations\r\n\r\nSpiriVerse hosts two categories of services: synchronous (real-time) and asynchronous (delivered over a period of time). Cancellation rules differ by category and by the cancellation policy tier set by each partner.\r\n\r\n### 3.1 Synchronous Services\r\n\r\nSynchronous services are delivered in real time and include tarot readings, astrology consultations, reiki sessions, coaching, energy healing, and similar offerings. These may be delivered in person, online, by phone, or at a mobile location.\r\n\r\n**Confirmation workflow:** After you book a synchronous service, the partner must confirm the booking. If the partner does not confirm or declines the booking, you will receive a full refund automatically.\r\n\r\n**Cancellation by the partner:** If the partner cancels a confirmed booking, you will receive a full refund.\r\n\r\n**Cancellation by you:** Your refund depends on the partner's cancellation policy tier (see [Section 3.3](#33-cancellation-policy-tiers)).\r\n\r\n### 3.2 Asynchronous Services\r\n\r\nAsynchronous services are delivered over a specified turnaround period and include written readings, oracle messages, voice note deliveries, and similar offerings. Before booking, you may be asked to complete a questionnaire so the partner can prepare your delivery.\r\n\r\n- **Before the partner begins work:** You may cancel and receive a full refund, regardless of the cancellation policy tier, provided the partner confirms they have not yet started.\r\n- **After the partner has begun work:** Refund eligibility depends on the cancellation policy tier and how much of the work has been completed.\r\n- **If the partner fails to deliver within the stated turnaround period:** You are entitled to a full refund.\r\n- **If the delivery is materially deficient or not as described:** You may request a refund or re-delivery through the dispute process.\r\n\r\n### 3.3 Cancellation and Refund Policies\r\n\r\nEach Partner defines their own cancellation and refund policy for their services. The applicable policy is displayed on the service listing and at checkout before you complete your booking.\r\n\r\nSpiriVerse requires all Partners to honour their stated cancellation and refund policies. If a Partner fails to do so, you may escalate the matter through our dispute process (see [Section 10](#10-dispute-escalation)).\r\n\r\n**Note:** Cancellation policies apply to voluntary cancellations by the buyer. If the service was not delivered as described, was of unacceptable quality, or the Partner failed to show up, you are entitled to a full refund regardless of the stated cancellation policy.\r\n\r\n**Platform Fees:** SpiriVerse Platform Fees are non-refundable in all cases, regardless of whether a refund is issued to the buyer.\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4. Event and Workshop Refunds\r\n\r\nEvents and workshops on SpiriVerse include moon circles, meditation classes, ceremonies, yoga sessions, retreats, and similar gatherings. Events may offer multiple ticket variants at different price points.\r\n\r\n### 4.1 Cancellation by the Organiser\r\n\r\nIf an event is cancelled by the organiser, all ticket holders will receive a full refund.\r\n\r\n### 4.2 Cancellation by You\r\n\r\n- **More than 7 days before the event:** Full refund, minus any non-refundable booking fees (if applicable and disclosed at checkout).\r\n- **Between 7 days and 48 hours before the event:** 50% refund, unless the organiser's policy is more generous.\r\n- **Less than 48 hours before the event:** Generally non-refundable, unless the organiser's policy permits it or statutory rights apply.\r\n- Organisers may set more generous refund terms, which will be displayed on the event listing.\r\n\r\n### 4.3 Ticket Transfers\r\n\r\nWhere an organiser permits ticket transfers, you may transfer your ticket to another person instead of requesting a refund. Transfer availability is shown on the event listing. SpiriVerse does not charge a fee for ticket transfers, though the organiser may set their own terms.\r\n\r\n### 4.4 Waitlists\r\n\r\nIf you are on a waitlist and a spot becomes available, you will be notified and given a window of time to confirm. If you do not confirm, your spot will be offered to the next person on the waitlist. No charge is made until you confirm and complete the booking.\r\n\r\n### 4.5 Event Date or Venue Changes\r\n\r\nIf an organiser materially changes the date, time, or venue of an event after you have purchased a ticket, you are entitled to a full refund if the change means you can no longer attend.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 5. Digital Content\r\n\r\nDigital content on SpiriVerse includes videos, podcasts, guided meditations, courses, downloadable files, and livestream recordings.\r\n\r\n### 5.1 General Rule\r\n\r\nDigital content is **generally non-refundable** once you have accessed, downloaded, or streamed the content. By purchasing digital content and accessing it, you acknowledge that you are receiving immediate access and that your right of withdrawal (where applicable) is waived upon access.\r\n\r\n### 5.2 Exceptions\r\n\r\nYou may be eligible for a refund on digital content if:\r\n\r\n- The content is materially different from its description or listing.\r\n- The content is inaccessible due to a technical issue on SpiriVerse or the partner's end that cannot be resolved within a reasonable timeframe.\r\n- You have not accessed, downloaded, or streamed any part of the content and you request a refund within 14 days of purchase.\r\n- Your statutory rights entitle you to a refund (for example, if the content is of unacceptable quality).\r\n\r\n### 5.3 Subscriptions and Courses\r\n\r\nIf digital content is sold as a subscription or multi-part course, refund eligibility may depend on how much of the content you have accessed. Specific terms will be displayed at checkout.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 6. How to Request a Refund\r\n\r\nTo request a refund:\r\n\r\n1. **Log in to your SpiriVerse account** and navigate to your order history.\r\n2. **Select the transaction** you wish to request a refund for.\r\n3. **Choose \"Request Refund\"** and select the reason for your request.\r\n4. **Provide supporting information**, including a description of the issue. For physical product issues, you may upload photos or videos as evidence.\r\n5. **Submit your request.** The partner will be notified and has **7 calendar days** to respond.\r\n\r\nYou will receive email updates as your refund request progresses. You can track the status of your request in your account dashboard. Refund requests move through the following statuses:\r\n\r\n- **PENDING** -- Your request has been submitted and is awaiting partner review.\r\n- **IN_PROGRESS** -- The partner is reviewing your request or a return is underway.\r\n- **APPROVED** -- Your refund has been approved and is being processed.\r\n- **REJECTED** -- The partner has declined your request. You may escalate to SpiriVerse (see [Section 10](#10-dispute-escalation)).\r\n- **REVERSED** -- A previously approved refund has been reversed (this occurs only in cases of fraud or policy violation).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 7. Refund Processing Timeframes\r\n\r\nOnce a refund is approved:\r\n\r\n- **Original payment method (card/bank):** Refunds are typically processed within **5-10 business days**, depending on your financial institution.\r\n- **Store credit:** Applied to your SpiriVerse account **within 1-2 business days**.\r\n- **Bank transfer:** Processed within **5-10 business days**.\r\n\r\nPartners have **7 calendar days** to respond to a refund request. If the partner does not respond within this period, the auto-refund mechanism may apply (see [Section 11](#11-auto-refund-mechanism)).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 8. Refund Methods\r\n\r\nDepending on the transaction and partner configuration, refunds may be issued via one or more of the following methods:\r\n\r\n- **Original payment method:** The refund is returned to the card or payment method used for the original purchase. This is the default refund method.\r\n- **Store credit:** The refund amount is credited to your SpiriVerse account balance, which can be used for future purchases on the platform.\r\n- **Bank transfer:** In some cases, a refund may be issued directly to your bank account.\r\n\r\nThe available refund methods for your transaction will be presented during the refund request process. Where permitted by law, partners may offer store credit as an alternative to a monetary refund for voluntary returns (change of mind). However, you are always entitled to a refund to your original payment method where your statutory rights apply.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 9. Partner Obligations\r\n\r\nAll partners on SpiriVerse agree to the following obligations regarding refunds and returns:\r\n\r\n- **Respond to refund requests within 7 calendar days.** Failure to respond may trigger an automatic refund to the buyer.\r\n- **Clearly display refund and cancellation policies** on all product listings, service pages, and event pages before checkout.\r\n- **Honour their stated policies.** Partners must process refunds in accordance with the terms they have published.\r\n- **Comply with applicable consumer protection laws** in the jurisdictions where they operate (Australia, United Kingdom, United States).\r\n- **Provide fair and accurate product/service descriptions.** Misleading descriptions that result in refund claims may lead to account action.\r\n- **Process approved returns promptly.** Once a return is received, partners should inspect the item and approve or escalate the refund within a reasonable timeframe.\r\n- **Bear return shipping costs for faulty or not-as-described items.**\r\n\r\nSpiriVerse reserves the right to take action against partners who consistently fail to meet these obligations, including suspension of selling privileges.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 10. Dispute Escalation\r\n\r\nIf you and the partner cannot reach a resolution, you may escalate the dispute to SpiriVerse for review.\r\n\r\n### 10.1 When to Escalate\r\n\r\nYou may escalate a dispute if:\r\n\r\n- The partner has rejected your refund request and you believe the rejection is unjustified.\r\n- The partner has not responded to your refund request within 7 calendar days.\r\n- You and the partner have reached an impasse after direct communication.\r\n\r\n### 10.2 How to Escalate\r\n\r\nFrom your refund request in the SpiriVerse dashboard, select \"Escalate to SpiriVerse.\" You may provide additional information and evidence to support your case.\r\n\r\n### 10.3 Resolution Process\r\n\r\n- SpiriVerse will review the details of the transaction, the refund request, the partner's response (if any), and any evidence provided by both parties.\r\n- SpiriVerse aims to resolve escalated disputes within **10 business days**, though complex cases may take longer.\r\n- SpiriVerse's decision is intended to be fair to both parties. Possible outcomes include full refund, partial refund, store credit, or denial of the refund request.\r\n- SpiriVerse's dispute resolution does not limit your right to pursue remedies through external channels, including consumer protection agencies or courts.\r\n\r\n### 10.4 Evidence\r\n\r\nBoth buyers and partners may upload photos, videos, screenshots, or written statements as evidence during the dispute process. Providing clear evidence helps SpiriVerse reach a fair resolution more quickly.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 11. Auto-Refund Mechanism\r\n\r\nTo protect buyers from unresponsive partners, SpiriVerse operates an auto-refund mechanism:\r\n\r\n- If a partner does not respond to a refund request within **7 calendar days**, the refund may be **automatically approved and processed** in favour of the buyer.\r\n- The auto-refund is issued to the buyer's original payment method.\r\n- Partners are notified at the time of the refund request and receive reminders before the auto-refund deadline.\r\n- The auto-refund mechanism does not apply where the partner has already responded to the request (even if the response is a rejection -- in that case, you may escalate per [Section 10](#10-dispute-escalation)).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 12. Your Statutory Rights\r\n\r\n### 12.1 Australia -- Australian Consumer Law\r\n\r\nIf you are a consumer in Australia, you have rights under the Australian Consumer Law (Schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010) that cannot be excluded, restricted, or modified by this policy or any partner policy. These include:\r\n\r\n- **Consumer guarantees:** Goods must be of acceptable quality, match their description, be fit for their disclosed purpose, and match any sample or demonstration model. Services must be provided with due care and skill, be fit for purpose, and be delivered within a reasonable time.\r\n- **Right to a remedy:** If a product or service fails to meet a consumer guarantee, you are entitled to a remedy. For major failures, you can choose a refund or replacement. For minor failures, the partner may choose to repair, replace, or refund.\r\n- **Services not yet provided:** You may cancel a service that has not yet been provided and receive a refund for any amount paid in advance.\r\n- **No contracting out:** Any term of a partner's policy that attempts to exclude or limit these guarantees is void.\r\n\r\nFor more information, visit the [Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)](https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/consumer-rights-guarantees).\r\n\r\n### 12.2 United Kingdom -- Consumer Rights Act 2015\r\n\r\nIf you are a consumer in the United Kingdom, you have rights under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 that cannot be excluded or restricted by this policy or any partner policy. These include:\r\n\r\n- **Goods must be of satisfactory quality**, fit for purpose, and as described. If goods are faulty or not as described, you have the right to a refund, repair, or replacement.\r\n- **Short-term right to reject:** You have 30 days from delivery to reject faulty goods for a full refund.\r\n- **Right to repair or replacement:** After 30 days, you have the right to request a repair or replacement. If this is not possible or unsuccessful, you may be entitled to a price reduction or final right to reject.\r\n- **Digital content** must be of satisfactory quality, fit for purpose, and as described. If digital content is faulty, you have the right to a repair or replacement, and if that fails, a price reduction.\r\n- **Services** must be performed with reasonable care and skill. If a service is not performed with reasonable care and skill, you are entitled to a repeat performance or a price reduction.\r\n- **Cancellation rights:** For contracts concluded at a distance (online), you generally have a 14-day cooling-off period in which you may cancel for any reason and receive a full refund. This right may not apply to certain categories, such as personalised goods, sealed goods opened after delivery, or digital content once downloading or streaming has begun with your consent.\r\n\r\nFor more information, visit [Citizens Advice](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/).\r\n\r\n### 12.3 United States -- State Consumer Protection\r\n\r\nConsumer protection laws in the United States vary by state. While there is no single federal right-of-return law for online purchases, many states have consumer protection statutes that may provide you with additional rights. General protections include:\r\n\r\n- **FTC Act protections:** The Federal Trade Commission Act prohibits unfair or deceptive business practices. Partners must deliver goods as described and within promised timeframes.\r\n- **Mail, Internet, or Telephone Order Merchandise Rule:** If a partner cannot ship within the promised timeframe (or 30 days if no timeframe is specified), they must notify you and offer the option to cancel for a full refund.\r\n- **State-specific rights:** Many states have consumer protection statutes, cooling-off periods for certain transactions, and warranty laws (including implied warranties of merchantability). Your rights may vary depending on your state of residence.\r\n- **Credit card chargebacks:** Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, you may have the right to dispute charges with your credit card issuer for goods or services not delivered as described.\r\n\r\nWe encourage US-based buyers to familiarise themselves with the consumer protection laws in their state. For general information, visit the [Federal Trade Commission (FTC)](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 13. Exceptions and Exclusions\r\n\r\nThe following exceptions and exclusions apply to this policy. These do not override your statutory rights.\r\n\r\n### 13.1 Items Not Eligible for Voluntary Return\r\n\r\nThe following items are generally not eligible for voluntary (change-of-mind) returns, unless they are faulty, damaged, or not as described:\r\n\r\n- **Personalised or custom-made items** created specifically to your specifications.\r\n- **Perishable goods** such as candles, incense, or herbal products that have been opened or used.\r\n- **Intimate or hygiene-sensitive items** where return would pose a health or safety concern.\r\n- **Items explicitly marked as final sale** on the product listing at the time of purchase.\r\n- **Gift cards and store credit** (non-refundable and non-transferable for cash, except where required by law).\r\n\r\n### 13.2 Abuse of Refund Policy\r\n\r\nSpiriVerse reserves the right to limit or deny refund requests from buyers who demonstrate a pattern of refund abuse, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Repeatedly claiming items were not received when delivery tracking confirms otherwise.\r\n- Returning items in a materially different condition than when received.\r\n- Systematically requesting refunds after consuming or using services or digital content.\r\n- Filing fraudulent chargebacks.\r\n\r\nIf SpiriVerse determines that refund abuse has occurred, we may restrict the buyer's ability to request refunds, suspend the buyer's account, or take other appropriate action.\r\n\r\n### 13.3 Force Majeure\r\n\r\nNeither SpiriVerse nor its partners are liable for delays or failures caused by events beyond reasonable control, including natural disasters, pandemics, government actions, or disruptions to postal or delivery services. In such cases, SpiriVerse will work with partners and buyers to find a fair resolution.\r\n\r\n### 13.4 Third-Party Services\r\n\r\n**Platform Fees are non-refundable in all cases**, regardless of whether a refund is issued to the buyer. SpiriVerse is not responsible for refunds related to third-party services (such as payment processing fees) that may not be recoverable.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 14.
