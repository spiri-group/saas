### 2.4 One Account Per Entity

Each legal entity or individual may maintain only one Partner account. Operating multiple accounts without prior written approval from SpiriVerse is prohibited.

---

## 3. Stripe Connected Account Requirements

### 3.1 Stripe Integration

SpiriVerse uses Stripe as its payment processing partner. As a condition of receiving payments through the Platform, you must:

- (a) Create and maintain a Stripe Connected Account linked to your SpiriVerse partner account;
- (b) Complete all identity verification and onboarding steps required by Stripe;
- (c) Agree to and comply with Stripe's [Connected Account Agreement](https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal) and [Terms of Service](https://stripe.com/legal); and

### 3.2 Stripe Compliance

You acknowledge that Stripe may independently suspend, restrict, or terminate your Connected Account in accordance with its own policies. SpiriVerse is not responsible for actions taken by Stripe, though we will make reasonable efforts to assist you in resolving issues.

### 3.3 Payment Card Requirement

You must save a valid payment card to your SpiriVerse account. This card is used for Subscription billing and any fees or adjustments owed to SpiriVerse. Payouts will be blocked until a valid payment card is on file (see Section 7).

---

## 4. Go-Live Requirements

### 4.1 Publishing Gating

Your Storefront will not be published or visible to Customers until all of the following requirements are met:

- (a) **Payment card saved** -- A valid payment card must be on file for Subscription and fee billing;
- (b) **Payment method configured** -- Your payout banking details must be fully configured; and
- (c) **Stripe onboarding complete** -- Your Stripe Connected Account must be fully verified and in good standing.

### 4.2 Automatic Publication

Once all three go-live requirements are satisfied, your Storefront may be automatically published. You are responsible for ensuring your Listings and Storefront content are ready before completing the final go-live requirement.

### 4.3 Suspension of Published Status

If any go-live requirement ceases to be met (for example, your payment card expires or your Stripe account is restricted), your Storefront may be suspended from public visibility until the requirement is restored.

---

## 5. Subscription and Billing

### 5.1 Subscription Plans

Access to the Platform as a Partner requires an active Subscription. We offer:

- (a) **Monthly billing** -- Billed on a recurring monthly cycle; and
- (b) **Yearly billing** -- Billed on a recurring annual cycle, typically at a discounted rate compared to monthly billing.

Current Subscription pricing is displayed in your partner dashboard and on our pricing page.

### 5.2 Deferred Billing Start

Your Subscription billing does not begin at account creation. Instead, billing commences when your **first payout is initiated** through the Platform. This means you can set up your Storefront, configure your Listings, and prepare your account without incurring Subscription charges until you start earning revenue.

### 5.3 Billing Cycle

Once billing begins:

- (a) Monthly Subscriptions renew on the same day each month (or the last day of the month if the original date does not exist in a given month);
- (b) Yearly Subscriptions renew on the anniversary of your billing start date; and
- (c) All charges are billed to the payment card on file.

### 5.4 Failed Payments

If a Subscription payment fails, we will:

- (a) Notify you by email;
- (b) Retry the charge according to our retry schedule; and
- (c) If payment remains unsuccessful after reasonable retry attempts, suspend your account until the outstanding balance is resolved.

### 5.5 Cancellation

You may cancel your Subscription at any time through your partner dashboard. Upon cancellation:

- (a) Your Subscription remains active until the end of the current billing period;
- (b) Your Storefront will be unpublished at the end of the billing period;
- (c) You remain responsible for fulfilling any outstanding orders, bookings, or event commitments;
- (d) No partial refunds are issued for unused portions of a billing period; and
- (e) You may reactivate your account by resubscribing, subject to these Partner Terms.

### 5.6 Price Changes

We reserve the right to change Subscription pricing with at least 30 days' written notice. Price changes take effect at the start of your next billing cycle following the notice period.

---

## 6. Platform Fees

### 6.1 Fee Structure

SpiriVerse charges a Platform Fee on each Customer transaction processed through the Platform. Fees consist of two components:

- (a) **Percentage component** -- A percentage of the transaction amount; and
- (b) **Fixed component** -- A fixed amount per transaction, denominated in the smallest currency unit of your Market (e.g., cents for AUD/USD, pence for GBP).

### 6.2 Market-Based Fees

Fee rates vary by Market (Australia, United Kingdom, United States). Each Market has its own fee schedule reflecting local payment processing costs, currency considerations, and regulatory requirements. Your applicable fee schedule is determined by the Market you selected during onboarding.

### 6.3 Fee Transparency

Your current fee rates are always visible in your partner dashboard. Before completing onboarding, the applicable fees for your Market will be clearly displayed for your review.

### 6.4 Fee Collection

Platform Fees are deducted automatically from each transaction before the net amount is credited to your Connected Account. You will receive a clear breakdown of gross amount, Platform Fee, and net amount for every transaction.

### 6.5 Additional Payment Processing Fees

In addition to SpiriVerse Platform Fees, Stripe charges its own payment processing fees. These fees are governed by your agreement with Stripe and are separate from SpiriVerse fees. Combined fee information is displayed in your transaction records.

### 6.6 Fee Changes

We may adjust fee rates with at least 30 days' written notice. Updated fees apply to transactions occurring after the effective date. If you do not agree to the revised fees, you may cancel your Subscription before the changes take effect.

If any of these prerequisites are not met, Payouts will be blocked until the issue is resolved.

### 7.2 Payout Schedule

Payouts are processed according to the schedule configured in your Stripe Connected Account, subject to Stripe's standard payout timing for your Market. Typical payout timing varies by Market and may be affected by weekends, public holidays, and banking processing times.

SpiriVerse and/or Stripe may place temporary holds on Payouts in the following circumstances:

- (a) Suspected fraudulent activity;
- (b) Unresolved Customer disputes or chargebacks;

- (e) As required by law or regulation.

We will notify you promptly if a hold is placed on your Payouts and provide guidance on resolving the issue.

### 7.4 Minimum Payout Amounts

Stripe may enforce minimum payout thresholds. If your balance does not meet the minimum, the balance will carry forward until the threshold is reached.

## 24. Insurance Recommendations

- (b) **Public liability / general liability insurance** -- Particularly for Partners hosting in-person events or providing in-person services;
- (c) **Product liability insurance** -- For Partners selling physical products;
- (d) **Cyber liability insurance** -- For Partners handling significant volumes of Customer data; and
- (e) **Business interruption insurance** -- To protect against revenue loss from unexpected disruptions.

### 24.2 Your Responsibility

Insurance coverage is your sole responsibility. SpiriVerse does not provide insurance to Partners and is not liable for any losses that would have been covered by appropriate insurance.
