## 1. What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device (computer, tablet, or mobile phone) when you visit a website. They allow the website to recognise your device and remember information about your visit, such as your preferences, login state, and browsing activity.

Cookies can be "first-party" (set by the website you are visiting) or "third-party" (set by a service used by the website, such as an analytics or payment provider). They can also be "session" cookies (deleted when you close your browser) or "persistent" cookies (remaining on your device for a set period or until you delete them).
