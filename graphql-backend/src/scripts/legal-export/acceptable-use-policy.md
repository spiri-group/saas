## 1. Purpose and Scope

This Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP") governs all use of the SpiriVerse platform, including its marketplace, partner services, events, livestreaming, on-demand content, community features, and messaging systems. It applies to all users. A "Partner" is any individual or business that lists services, products, or experiences on SpiriVerse.

It applies to all users---partners, event hosts, content creators, and community members---across all regions in which SpiriVerse operates (Australia, United Kingdom, and United States).

SpiriVerse is a spiritual marketplace built on respect for diverse traditions, honest practice, and the wellbeing of every member of our community. This policy exists to maintain a trustworthy environment where spiritual seekers can explore, learn, and grow safely, and where partners can offer their gifts with integrity.

By accessing or using SpiriVerse, you agree to comply with this AUP. This policy supplements our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

The following activities, content, and behaviors are strictly prohibited on SpiriVerse. This list is not exhaustive; SpiriVerse reserves the right to take action against any conduct that violates the spirit of this policy.

### 3.1 Fraudulent Spiritual Practices

- Delivering fabricated, scripted, or pre-manufactured readings, predictions, or channeled messages presented as genuine spiritual work.
- Using cold reading techniques, data harvesting, or social engineering to simulate psychic or intuitive ability.

- Misrepresenting qualifications, training, lineage, certifications, or experience.

### 3.2 Medical, Legal, and Financial Claims

- Diagnosing, treating, or claiming to cure any medical or psychological condition.
- Advising users to discontinue prescribed medications, therapies, or medical treatments.
- Providing legal advice or representing oneself as a legal professional.
- Providing specific financial or investment advice or representing oneself as a licensed financial advisor.
- Marketing any product or service as a substitute for professional medical, legal, or financial consultation.

Partners are expected to make clear that spiritual services are complementary in nature and do not replace professional advice. Where appropriate, partners must encourage clients to seek qualified professional help.

- Posting sexually explicit images, videos, or text in any area of the platform.

SpiriVerse respects the distinction between open and closed spiritual practices. The following is prohibited:

- Commercializing sacred items, ceremonies, or practices from closed traditions without proper cultural authority.

## 4. Product Listing Standards

Partners listing products on SpiriVerse must adhere to the following:

- **Accurate descriptions:** All product listings must accurately describe the item, including materials, dimensions, weight, origin, and any relevant properties. Claims about metaphysical or spiritual properties must be presented as traditional beliefs or personal perspectives, not as guaranteed effects.
- **Clear imagery:** Product photos must accurately represent the item being sold. Stock photos may be used only when clearly labeled as representative images, and the listing must state that the actual item may vary.
- **Proper categorization:** Products must be listed in the correct categories and tagged appropriately.
- **Legal compliance:** All products must comply with applicable consumer protection, product safety, and import/export laws in the jurisdictions where they are sold (AU, UK, US). Partners are responsible for understanding and meeting these requirements.
- **Ingredient and material disclosure:** Products containing herbs, essential oils, resins, or other substances must include a full ingredient list and relevant safety warnings (e.g., allergens, not for internal use, keep away from pets).
- **Shipping and returns:** Listings must include clear information about shipping timelines, costs, and return policies consistent with SpiriVerse marketplace requirements.
- **No misleading claims:** Partners must not claim that products will produce specific physical, medical, or guaranteed spiritual outcomes.

---

## 5. Service Delivery Standards

Partners offering services on SpiriVerse must adhere to the following:

- **Accurate representation:** Service listings must clearly describe what the client will receive, the duration, the format (live video, phone, chat, in-person), and the price.
- **Timely delivery:** Services must be delivered within the timeframe communicated to the client. Partners must communicate promptly if scheduling changes are necessary.
- **Professional conduct:** Partners must maintain professional boundaries at all times and conduct sessions in a respectful and ethical manner.
- **Informed consent:** Before beginning a session, partners must ensure the client understands the nature of the service, any limitations, and that the service is spiritual or complementary in nature and not a substitute for professional advice.
- **Confidentiality:** Information shared by clients during sessions must be treated as confidential and must not be disclosed to third parties, used for marketing, or shared publicly without explicit written consent.
- **Scope of practice:** Partners must operate within the scope of their training and experience. They must not offer services in modalities for which they are not trained or qualified.
- **Referrals:** When a client presents concerns that fall outside the partner's scope---particularly medical, psychological, legal, or financial matters---the partner must recommend that the client seek appropriate professional help.

---

## 6. Event Hosting Standards

Users hosting events, workshops, or gatherings through SpiriVerse must adhere to the following:

- **Accurate event descriptions:** Event listings must clearly describe the content, format, prerequisites (if any), duration, and cost. Any physical requirements or potential emotional intensity should be disclosed.
- **Qualified facilitation:** Event hosts must have appropriate knowledge, training, or experience for the content they are facilitating. Where events involve specific modalities (e.g., breathwork, shamanic journeying), the host must have relevant qualifications.
- **Safety and duty of care:** Hosts are responsible for creating a safe environment for participants, whether virtual or in-person. This includes establishing ground rules, managing group dynamics, and having a plan for addressing participant distress.
- **Capacity and access:** Event listings must accurately state capacity limits and accessibility information. Overbooking or misrepresenting access is prohibited.
- **Cancellation policies:** Hosts must clearly state cancellation and refund policies in the event listing and honor them consistently.
- **Recording and privacy:** If events will be recorded, hosts must disclose this in advance and obtain participant consent. Recordings must not be used for purposes beyond those disclosed.

---

## 7. Content Standards

All content shared on SpiriVerse---including livestreams, recorded video, podcasts, social posts, comments, and written materials---must meet the following standards:

- **Truthfulness:** Content must be honest and not intentionally misleading. Personal opinions, beliefs, and interpretations should be presented as such, not as universal facts.
- **Respect for diverse traditions:** Content must respect the diversity of spiritual paths represented on SpiriVerse. Criticizing or demeaning other traditions, practices, or belief systems is not permitted.
- **Age-appropriate content:** All content must be appropriate for a general audience. Content that includes mature themes must carry appropriate warnings.
- **Livestream conduct:** Livestream hosts are responsible for moderating chat in real time and addressing violations of this AUP that occur during their streams. Hosts must not use livestreams to pressure viewers into purchases or donations through manipulation.
- **No misinformation:** Content that promotes dangerous misinformation---particularly regarding health, safety, or emergency situations---is prohibited.
- **Attribution:** When sharing teachings, techniques, or content originated by others, proper attribution must be given.
- **Advertising restrictions:** Content must not include unsolicited advertising for external platforms, services, or products unrelated to the creator's SpiriVerse presence, unless explicitly permitted by SpiriVerse.

---

## 8. Community Conduct

All community interactions---including messaging, reviews, social posts, and comments---are governed by the following expectations:

- **Respectful communication:** Engage with others respectfully, even when you disagree. Debate and discussion are welcome; personal attacks are not.
- **Constructive reviews:** Reviews should reflect genuine experiences and provide constructive feedback. They should focus on the product, service, or experience rather than personal attacks against the partner.
- **Honest social engagement:** Social posts and comments should be authentic. Artificially amplifying content, coordinating inauthentic behavior, or using deceptive tactics to influence community discourse is prohibited.
- **Messaging boundaries:** Respect other users' boundaries in messaging. Do not send repeated messages after being asked to stop, and do not use messaging for purposes unrelated to legitimate platform activity.
- **No solicitation outside the platform:** Using SpiriVerse community features to redirect users to external platforms in order to circumvent SpiriVerse's systems (e.g., payments, reviews, dispute resolution) is prohibited.
- **Reporting in good faith:** Users are encouraged to report violations of this AUP. Filing false, malicious, or retaliatory reports is itself a violation of this policy.

---

## 9. Partner Obligations

In addition to the service delivery standards outlined in Section 5, partners on SpiriVerse accept the following obligations:

- **Honesty and integrity:** Partners must represent their abilities, experience, and the nature of their services honestly. Spiritual work inherently involves subjective experience; partners must not exploit this subjectivity to mislead clients.
- **Scope of practice:** Partners must clearly define and operate within their scope of practice. A tarot reader should not present themselves as a licensed therapist; an energy healer should not claim to diagnose disease. Where modalities overlap with regulated professions, partners must make the distinction clear.
- **Appropriate referrals:** Partners must refer clients to qualified professionals when the client's needs exceed the partner's scope. This is particularly critical when clients present signs of mental health crisis, medical emergency, abuse, or legal jeopardy.
- **Continuing development:** Partners are encouraged to pursue ongoing learning, mentorship, and professional development within their modalities.
- **Ethical pricing:** Partners must price their services fairly and transparently. Where sliding-scale or donation-based pricing is offered, the terms must be clearly stated.
- **Client autonomy:** Partners must respect client autonomy and the client's right to make their own decisions. Creating dependency, overriding client agency, or using spiritual authority to control clients is prohibited.
- **Record keeping:** Partners are encouraged to maintain appropriate records of client interactions to support accountability and continuity of care, in compliance with applicable privacy laws.

---

## 10. Intellectual Property

All users must respect intellectual property rights:

- Do not upload, share, or sell content (images, text, video, audio, designs) that you do not own or have the right to use.
- Do not reproduce or distribute copyrighted materials---including tarot spread designs, course content, written readings, or proprietary methodologies---without permission from the rights holder.
- Do not use another user's branding, business name, likeness, or proprietary content without their explicit consent.
- Respect trademarks and trade dress. Do not create listings or content that could cause confusion with established brands or partners.

## 12. Enforcement Actions

SpiriVerse takes a graduated approach to enforcement, considering the severity of the violation, the user's history, and the potential for harm. Enforcement actions may include, but are not limited to:

1. **Warning:** A formal notice identifying the violation and requiring corrective action. First-time or minor violations will typically result in a warning with guidance on how to comply.

2. **Content removal:** Removal of specific listings, posts, reviews, messages, or other content that violates this AUP.

3. **Feature restriction:** Temporary restriction of specific platform features (e.g., messaging, livestreaming, event hosting, posting) while a violation is under review or as a corrective measure.

4. **Temporary suspension:** Suspension of the user's account for a defined period. During suspension, the user will be unable to access the platform. Partners' listings and partners' bookings will be paused.

5. **Permanent termination:** Permanent removal from the platform. This action is reserved for severe violations, repeated offenses after prior warnings, or conduct that poses a significant risk to the safety of the community. Terminated users may not create new accounts.

6. **Financial holds:** In cases involving fraud, disputes, or significant policy violations, SpiriVerse may place holds on pending payouts pending investigation and resolution.

**Severity considerations:**

- Violations involving fraud, exploitation of vulnerable individuals, or immediate safety risks may result in immediate suspension or termination without a prior warning.
- Repeated minor violations, after warnings, may escalate to suspension or termination.
- SpiriVerse will consider context, intent, and willingness to correct behavior when determining enforcement actions.

---

## 13. Appeals Process

Users who receive an enforcement action have the right to appeal. The appeals process is as follows:

1. **Submit an appeal:** Send an email to **trust@spiriverse.com** with the subject line "Policy Appeal -- [Your Username]" within 30 calendar days of receiving the enforcement notice. Include:
   - Your account information.
   - The enforcement action you are appealing.
   - A clear explanation of why you believe the action was incorrect or disproportionate.
   - Any supporting evidence or context.

2. **Review:** Appeals are reviewed by a member of the Trust & Safety team who was not involved in the original enforcement decision. SpiriVerse may consult subject-matter experts, cultural advisors, or community representatives as appropriate.

3. **Decision:** You will receive a written response within 14 business days of your appeal submission. The response will explain the outcome and reasoning. Possible outcomes include:
   - **Reversal:** The enforcement action is overturned and your account is restored to its prior state.
   - **Modification:** The enforcement action is adjusted (e.g., a suspension is shortened or a termination is reduced to a suspension).
   - **Upholding:** The original enforcement action is maintained.

4. **Finality:** The appeal decision is final. SpiriVerse will not engage in further review of the same enforcement action unless significant new evidence is presented.
