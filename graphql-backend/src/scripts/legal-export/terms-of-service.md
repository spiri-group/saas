- (f) Any other matter relating to the Platform.

### 17.2 Cap on Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the total aggregate liability of SpiriVerse to you for all claims arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the Platform shall not exceed the greater of: (a) the total amount of fees you have paid to SpiriVerse in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim; or (b) one hundred dollars (USD $100) or the equivalent in your local currency.

### 17.3 Jurisdictional Variations

- **(a) Australia:** Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts, or modifies any consumer guarantee, right, or remedy conferred by the Australian Consumer Law or any other applicable law that cannot be excluded, restricted, or modified by agreement. To the extent permitted by law, SpiriVerse's liability for breach of any non-excludable consumer guarantee is limited, at SpiriVerse's option, to the resupply of the services or the payment of the cost of having the services resupplied.
- **(b) United Kingdom:** Nothing in these Terms limits or excludes liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, or any other liability that cannot be limited or excluded by law. For UK consumers, these Terms do not affect your statutory rights under the Consumer Rights Act 2015.
- **(c) United States:** Some US states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you. In such states, SpiriVerse's liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

Before initiating any formal dispute resolution process, you agree to first contact SpiriVerse at contact@spiriverse.com and attempt to resolve the dispute informally for a period of at least thirty (30) days.

### 21.2 Australia

For Users resident in Australia, disputes that cannot be resolved informally may be referred to mediation administered by the Australian Disputes Centre (ADC) in accordance with the ADC Mediation Guidelines. If mediation is unsuccessful, either party may commence proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this section prevents you from lodging a complaint with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) or your state or territory fair trading agency.

### 21.3 United Kingdom

For Users resident in the United Kingdom, disputes that cannot be resolved informally may be referred to an approved Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) provider.

### 21.4 United States

For Users resident in the United States:

- **(a) Binding Arbitration:** Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Platform that cannot be resolved informally shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
- **(b) Class Action Waiver:** You agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you waive any right to a jury trial.

- **(d) Opt-Out:** You may opt out of the arbitration and class action waiver provisions by sending written notice to contact@spiriverse.com within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms. Your notice must include your name, address, and a clear statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration.

The invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity, legality, or enforceability of the remaining provisions, which shall continue in full force and effect.
