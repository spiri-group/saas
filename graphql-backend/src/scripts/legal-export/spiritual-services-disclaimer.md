# Spiritual Services Disclaimer

**Effective Date:** [EFFECTIVE_DATE]
**Last Updated:** [EFFECTIVE_DATE]

This Spiritual Services Disclaimer ("Disclaimer") applies to all services, products, and content offered through the SpiriVerse platform ("Platform"), operated by [COMPANY_ENTITY] ("SpiriVerse," "we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using the Platform, you ("User," "you," or "your") acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the terms of this Disclaimer.

---

## 1. Nature of Spiritual Services

### 1.1 Purpose and Intent

The spiritual services available on SpiriVerse -- including but not limited to tarot and oracle readings, astrology (birth charts, transits, synastry), numerology, reiki, energy healing, crystal healing, sound healing, life coaching, spiritual counseling, breathwork, meditation guidance, shamanic practices, channeling, mediumship, past-life readings, and akashic records access -- are offered for the purposes of **personal growth, spiritual exploration, self-reflection, and entertainment**.

These services draw upon diverse spiritual traditions, intuitive practices, and holistic philosophies that many individuals find meaningful and valuable in their personal journeys. SpiriVerse respects the depth and significance of these traditions while maintaining transparency about their nature.

### 1.2 Delivery Methods

Services on the Platform may be delivered through various methods, including in-person sessions, online video consultations, phone sessions, mobile sessions (where the partner travels to the client's location), and asynchronous delivery (written readings, voice notes, oracle messages). This Disclaimer applies equally to all delivery methods.

### 1.3 What Spiritual Services Are Not

Spiritual services available through the Platform are **not** any of the following:

- **Medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.** No service offered on SpiriVerse constitutes medical care, and no partner on the Platform is providing medical services through their listings unless separately and explicitly licensed to do so.
- **Psychological or psychiatric counseling or therapy.** Spiritual counseling and life coaching are distinct from licensed mental health services.
- **Legal advice or legal representation.**
- **Financial advice, investment guidance, or tax consultation.**
- **A substitute for the advice of qualified, licensed professionals** in any regulated field.

---

## 2. No Diagnostic or Outcome Claims

### 2.1 No Health Diagnoses

No partner on the SpiriVerse platform is authorised to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any physical or mental health condition through the spiritual services offered on the Platform. Any information provided during a session that relates to health or wellbeing is offered as spiritual perspective only and must not be interpreted as a clinical diagnosis or medical opinion.

### 2.2 No Guaranteed Outcomes or Predictions

SpiriVerse and its partners **do not guarantee specific outcomes, results, or the accuracy of any predictions**. Spiritual readings, intuitive insights, astrological interpretations, and similar services reflect the partner's interpretation at the time of the session. The future is not fixed, and any forward-looking statements made during a session are possibilities, not certainties. Decisions you make based on information received during a spiritual service are made at your own discretion and risk.

### 2.3 Individual Experience

Results and experiences vary between individuals. The value derived from spiritual services is inherently subjective, and SpiriVerse makes no representations that any particular experience, insight, or transformation will occur.

---

## 3. Partner Independence

### 3.1 Independent Contractor Status

All Partners offering services through the SpiriVerse platform are **independent contractors**. A "Partner" is any individual or business that lists services, products, or experiences on SpiriVerse. They are not employees, agents, or representatives of SpiriVerse. Each partner operates their own independent practice and is solely responsible for:

- The content and quality of their services
- Their qualifications, certifications, and training claims
- Compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in their jurisdiction
- The accuracy of their service descriptions and any claims made during sessions
- Their own tax obligations and business registration
- Maintaining any required professional insurance

### 3.2 Partner Responsibility

Partners are individually responsible for the advice, guidance, and information they provide. SpiriVerse does not direct, supervise, or control the methods, content, or delivery of partner services beyond the Platform's terms of service and community guidelines.

### 3.3 SpiriVerse's Role

SpiriVerse provides a marketplace platform that connects Users with independent partners. We facilitate discovery, booking, communication, and payment processing. We do not provide spiritual services ourselves, and listing on the Platform does not constitute an endorsement by SpiriVerse of any partner's skills, abilities, qualifications, or the efficacy of their services.

---

## 4. No Endorsement of Specific Beliefs or Practices

### 4.1 Neutral Platform

SpiriVerse is a marketplace that hosts a diverse range of spiritual traditions and practices. **The presence of any service, modality, or product on the Platform does not constitute an endorsement, validation, or verification by SpiriVerse of the underlying spiritual beliefs, metaphysical claims, or efficacy of that practice.**

### 4.2 Diverse Traditions

The Platform encompasses services and products from many spiritual and cultural traditions. SpiriVerse does not take a position on the truth, validity, or superiority of any spiritual path, belief system, or practice over another. Users are encouraged to exercise their own discernment and judgement when engaging with any service or partner.

---

## 5. Products and Physical Goods

### 5.1 Spiritual and Metaphysical Products

Products available on SpiriVerse -- including crystals, healing stones, tarot and oracle decks, candles, incense, spiritual jewellery, books, meditation tools, and similar items -- may be described with reference to traditional, metaphysical, or spiritual properties and uses.

### 5.2 Traditional Beliefs, Not Scientific Claims

Descriptions of metaphysical properties, healing attributes, or spiritual benefits associated with products are **based on traditional beliefs, cultural practices, and historical use**. These descriptions are not based on scientific evidence and are not intended as claims of medical or therapeutic efficacy. For example:

- Statements about the "healing properties" of crystals reflect traditional and folk beliefs about those stones.
- Descriptions of candles, incense, or tools as having "cleansing" or "protective" qualities reference spiritual and ceremonial traditions.
- References to "energy" in product descriptions relate to spiritual or metaphysical concepts, not measurable physical energy.

### 5.3 No Therapeutic Claims

Products sold on the Platform are not medical devices, therapeutic tools, or regulated health products. They are sold as spiritual, decorative, or personal enrichment items. No product on SpiriVerse is intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or medical condition.

---

## 6. Energy Healing and Complementary Modalities

### 6.1 Complementary Nature

Energy healing modalities available on the Platform -- including reiki, crystal healing, sound healing, breathwork, and similar practices -- are **complementary modalities**. They are intended to be used alongside, not as a replacement for, conventional medical treatment and professional healthcare.

### 6.2 Not a Substitute for Medical Care

If you are experiencing a health concern, you should consult a qualified healthcare professional. Energy healing and similar services are not a substitute for:

- Visits to your doctor or specialist
- Prescribed medications or treatments
- Emergency medical care
- Licensed mental health services
- Any treatment plan established by a qualified healthcare provider

### 6.3 Informed Participation

By booking an energy healing or similar session, you acknowledge that you understand the complementary nature of these services and that you are not relying on them as a substitute for professional medical or psychological care.

---

## 7. Consult Qualified Professionals

SpiriVerse strongly encourages all Users to consult appropriately qualified and licensed professionals for matters involving:

- **Physical health:** Consult a licensed physician, specialist, or healthcare provider.
- **Mental health:** Consult a licensed psychologist, psychiatrist, counsellor, or therapist.
- **Legal matters:** Consult a licensed solicitor, barrister, or attorney.
- **Financial matters:** Consult a licensed financial adviser, accountant, or tax professional.

Information received during spiritual services should not be used as the sole basis for making important life decisions, particularly those involving health, legal, or financial matters.

---

## 8. Advisory for Vulnerable Individuals

### 8.1 Grief and Bereavement

If you are currently experiencing acute grief or bereavement, please be aware that services such as mediumship, channeling, or past-life readings may evoke strong emotional responses. We encourage you to consider whether you are in a suitable emotional state to engage with these services and to seek support from qualified grief counsellors or mental health professionals as appropriate.

### 8.2 Mental Health Considerations

If you are currently experiencing a mental health crisis, severe anxiety, depression, psychosis, or any acute psychological distress, spiritual services are **not** an appropriate substitute for professional mental health care. Please contact a qualified mental health professional or crisis service:

- **Australia:** Lifeline 13 11 14 | Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636
- **United Kingdom:** Samaritans 116 123 | NHS Crisis Line 111 (option 2)
- **United States:** 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (call or text 988)

### 8.3 Dependency Advisory

Spiritual services are intended to support your personal growth and autonomy, not to create dependency. If you find yourself relying on readings or spiritual advice for everyday decisions, we encourage you to reflect on this pattern and consider speaking with a licensed counsellor or therapist.

---

## 9. Age-Appropriate Content Advisory

### 9.1 General Audience

The SpiriVerse platform is intended for users who are of legal age in their jurisdiction (generally 18 years of age or older, or as otherwise specified in our Terms of Service).

### 9.2 Parental and Guardian Responsibility

Some spiritual content, themes, or practices discussed on the Platform may not be suitable for minors. Parents and guardians are responsible for monitoring and supervising any access to the Platform by individuals under their care.

### 9.3 Content Sensitivity

Certain services -- including mediumship, past-life readings, shamanic practices, and channeling -- may involve discussion of topics such as death, the afterlife, trauma, or other themes that some individuals may find sensitive or distressing. Users should exercise their own judgement regarding their readiness to engage with such content.

---

## 10. Cultural Sensitivity and Respect

### 10.1 Acknowledgment of Cultural Origins

SpiriVerse acknowledges that many spiritual practices offered on the Platform originate from specific cultural, indigenous, and religious traditions. We respect the origins and significance of these traditions and expect all partners and Users to engage with these practices in a spirit of respect, humility, and cultural awareness.

### 10.2 Partner Responsibility

Partners who offer services rooted in specific cultural traditions are expected to do so with appropriate knowledge, respect, and, where relevant, proper training or lineage within that tradition. SpiriVerse encourages partners to be transparent about their training, background, and connection to the traditions from which their practices derive.

### 10.3 User Awareness

Users are encouraged to approach spiritual services with an open mind and cultural sensitivity. If you have questions about the origins or cultural context of a particular practice, we encourage you to discuss this with the partner before booking.

---

## 11. Assumption of Risk

### 11.1 In-Person Services

If you engage in in-person spiritual services -- including sessions at a partner's location, your own location, or any other physical venue -- you assume the inherent risks associated with in-person interactions. These may include but are not limited to:

- Physical risks associated with activities such as breathwork, sound healing, or other body-engaged practices
- Risks associated with the burning of candles, incense, or sage
- Risks associated with allowing a mobile partner into your home or meeting at a third-party location
- General risks associated with travel to and from a session location

### 11.2 Emotional and Psychological Responses

Spiritual services may evoke unexpected or intense emotional, psychological, or physical responses. By engaging with services on the Platform, you acknowledge and accept this possibility and agree that SpiriVerse is not liable for emotional or psychological experiences arising from a session.

### 11.3 Personal Responsibility

You are responsible for your own wellbeing before, during, and after a spiritual service. This includes communicating any relevant health conditions, physical limitations, or emotional concerns to your partner before a session begins.

---

## 12. Limitation of Liability

### 12.1 No Liability for Service Outcomes

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, SpiriVerse, its officers, directors, employees, affiliates, and agents shall not be liable for:

- Any outcomes, results, or lack thereof arising from spiritual services obtained through the Platform
- Any decisions made by Users based on information, guidance, or insights received during spiritual services
- Any physical, emotional, psychological, or financial harm arising from the use of spiritual services or products obtained through the Platform
- Any actions or omissions of independent partners
- Any claims relating to the accuracy or efficacy of spiritual readings, predictions, or advice

### 12.2 Platform Liability

SpiriVerse's liability is limited to its role as a marketplace platform. We are not liable for the conduct, advice, or services provided by independent partners. To the maximum extent permitted by law, our total aggregate liability arising from your use of the Platform shall not exceed the amount you paid to SpiriVerse in platform fees (not partner fees) in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim.

### 12.3 No Consequential Damages

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, SpiriVerse shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, regardless of the cause of action or the theory of liability.

---

## 13. Multi-Jurisdiction Compliance

### 13.1 General

SpiriVerse operates across multiple jurisdictions, including Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. This Disclaimer is intended to comply with applicable consumer protection laws in each of these jurisdictions. Where any provision of this Disclaimer conflicts with mandatory local law, the local law shall prevail to the extent of the conflict.

### 13.2 Australia

In accordance with the Australian Consumer Law (Schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010), nothing in this Disclaimer excludes, restricts, or modifies any consumer guarantee, right, or remedy that cannot be excluded under Australian law. Any liability of SpiriVerse that cannot be excluded is limited, to the extent permitted by law, to the resupply of the services or the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again. Spiritual services are provided with the understanding that they fall within the category of personal services where outcomes are inherently subjective, and no specific result is guaranteed.

### 13.3 United Kingdom

In accordance with the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013, nothing in this Disclaimer affects your statutory rights as a consumer. Services are provided with reasonable care and skill. Partners and SpiriVerse do not exclude liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud, or fraudulent misrepresentation. The Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 apply to all services and products on the Platform; no misleading claims regarding the nature or efficacy of spiritual services are intended.

### 13.4 United States

Services and products on the Platform are offered in compliance with applicable federal and state consumer protection laws, including the Federal Trade Commission Act. In jurisdictions that regulate fortune-telling, psychic services, or similar activities, partners are responsible for compliance with all applicable local ordinances and state laws. SpiriVerse makes no representations that all spiritual services comply with every state and local regulation, and partners are independently responsible for such compliance. Nothing in this Disclaimer is intended to waive any rights that cannot be waived under applicable state consumer protection statutes. Any claims that cannot be resolved informally shall be subject to the dispute resolution mechanisms set forth in SpiriVerse's Terms of Service.

---

## 14. Partner Obligations

### 14.1 Ethical Conduct

All partners on the SpiriVerse platform are expected to conduct their services ethically, honestly, and with genuine care for their clients' wellbeing. Partners must not:

- Make claims of guaranteed outcomes or infallible predictions
- Diagnose medical or psychological conditions unless separately licensed to do so
- Encourage dependency or exploit vulnerable individuals
- Misrepresent their qualifications, training, or experience
- Use fear, manipulation, or coercion in the delivery of their services
- Make claims that their services can cure, treat, or prevent any medical condition

### 14.2 Scope of Practice

Partners must operate within the scope of their training and expertise. Where a client presents concerns that fall outside the partner's competence -- particularly matters involving physical health, mental health, legal issues, or financial matters -- the partner should recommend that the client consult a qualified professional.

### 14.3 Compliance

Partners are independently responsible for complying with all laws, regulations, and licensing requirements applicable to their services in their jurisdiction of operation. This includes but is not limited to business registration, tax obligations, insurance requirements, and any specific regulations governing spiritual, holistic, or wellness services.

---

## 15. Severability

If any provision of this Disclaimer is found to be unenforceable or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

---

## 16. Changes to This Disclaimer

SpiriVerse reserves the right to update or modify this Disclaimer at any time. Changes will be posted on the Platform with the updated effective date.
