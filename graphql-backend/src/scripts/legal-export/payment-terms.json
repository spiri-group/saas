Stripe is a globally recognised, PCI DSS Level 1 certified payment infrastructure provider. All payment transactions on the Platform are processed through Stripe's secure systems.\r\n\r\n### How Payments Work\r\n\r\n- **Customer payments** are processed through Stripe's payment infrastructure and routed to the relevant Partner's Stripe Connected Account.\r\n- **Partner accounts** are Stripe Connected Accounts created during onboarding. Partners must complete Stripe's identity verification and onboarding requirements before receiving payouts.\r\n- **Cart-based checkout** allows Customers to purchase from multiple Partners in a single order. Payments are split and routed to each respective Partner's Connected Account automatically.\r\n- **Platform fees** are deducted from Partner payments at the time of transaction before funds are settled to the Partner's Connected Account.\r\n\r\nSpiriVerse does not directly store, process, or transmit payment card data. All sensitive payment information is handled exclusively by Stripe.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2. Accepted Payment Methods\r\n\r\nSpiriVerse accepts the following payment methods via Stripe:\r\n\r\n- **Credit cards**: Visa, Mastercard, American Express\r\n- **Debit cards**: Visa Debit, Mastercard Debit\r\n- Additional payment methods as supported by Stripe in each operating market\r\n\r\n### Saved Payment Methods\r\n\r\n- Customers may save payment methods to their account for faster checkout using Stripe's Setup Intent flow.\r\n- Saved card details are stored securely by Stripe and are never stored on SpiriVerse servers.\r\n- Customers may add, update, or remove saved payment methods at any time through their account settings.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3. Currency and Pricing\r\n\r\nSpiriVerse operates across three markets, each with its own local currency:\r\n\r\n| Market | Currency | Currency Code |\r\n|--------|----------|---------------|\r\n| Australia | Australian Dollar | AUD |\r\n| United Kingdom | British Pound | GBP |\r\n| United States | US Dollar | USD |\r\n\r\n### Currency Selection\r\n\r\n- Currency is automatically determined by the market in which the Partner operates.\r\n- All prices displayed to Customers are in the local currency of the Partner's market.\r\n- Cross-currency transactions are not supported. Customers purchase from Partners within their local market currency.\r\n\r\n### Pricing Display\r\n\r\n- All prices displayed on the Platform are inclusive of any applicable platform fees charged to the Customer, clearly itemised during checkout.\r\n- Partners set their own product and service pricing. SpiriVerse does not control or regulate Partner pricing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4. Customer Payment Terms\r\n\r\n### Checkout Process\r\n\r\n- Customers add items to their cart and proceed through a secure checkout flow.\r\n- Orders may include items from multiple Partners in a single transaction. Each Partner's portion is processed and settled separately.\r\n- Payment is captured at the time of order confirmation.\r\n\r\n### Authorisation\r\n\r\n- By completing a purchase, the Customer authorises SpiriVerse and Stripe to charge the selected payment method for the full order amount, including any applicable Customer fees, shipping fees, and taxes.\r\n\r\n### Order Confirmation\r\n\r\n- Customers receive an order confirmation upon successful payment processing.\r\n- If payment fails at checkout, the order is not placed and the Customer is prompted to update their payment method or try again.\r\n\r\n### Customer Fees\r\n\r\n- Certain transactions may include a Customer fee, which covers a portion of payment processing costs. This fee is clearly displayed during checkout before the Customer confirms their order.\r\n- Customer fee rates vary by market and are detailed in the fee schedule available in the Platform's administrative settings.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 5. Platform Fee Structure and Transparency\r\n\r\nSpiriVerse operates a transparent, market-based fee structure. Fees vary by market (Australia, United Kingdom, United States) to reflect local payment processing costs and regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\n### Fee Components\r\n\r\nFees are composed of the following elements, which may apply individually or in combination depending on the transaction:\r\n\r\n| Fee Component | Description |\r\n|---------------|-------------|\r\n| **Partner Fee (Percentage)** | A percentage of the transaction amount deducted from the Partner's payment. |\r\n| **Partner Fee (Fixed)** | A fixed amount per transaction deducted from the Partner's payment, denominated in the smallest currency unit (e.g., cents). |\r\n| **Customer Fee (Percentage)** | A percentage of the transaction amount added to the Customer's total at checkout. |\r\n| **Customer Fee (Fixed)** | A fixed amount per transaction added to the Customer's total at checkout, denominated in the smallest currency unit. |\r\n| **Processing Fee** | Covers underlying payment processing costs incurred by the Platform. |\r\n| **Shipping Fee** | Shipping costs set by the Partner and charged to the Customer at checkout, where applicable. |\r\n| **Tax** | Applicable taxes as determined by the Partner's obligations in their jurisdiction. |\r\n\r\n### Fee Configuration\r\n\r\n- Fee rates are configured per market and stored in the Platform's System Settings.\r\n- Current fee rates for each market are available to Partners through their dashboard.\r\n- Platform administrators may adjust fee rates. Any changes are subject to the notification provisions in Section 12.\r\n\r\n### Fee Transparency\r\n\r\n- Partners can view the fee breakdown for each transaction in their dashboard.\r\n- Customers see all applicable fees clearly itemised during checkout before confirming their order.\r\n- No hidden fees are charged at any point in the transaction process.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 6. Partner Subscription Billing\r\n\r\nPartners on SpiriVerse pay a recurring subscription fee for access to the Platform.\r\n\r\n### Billing Frequency\r\n\r\nPartners may choose from the following billing cycles:\r\n\r\n- **Monthly billing**: Charged once per calendar month.\r\n- **Yearly billing**: Charged once per year, typically at a discounted rate compared to monthly billing.\r\n\r\n### Deferred Billing Start\r\n\r\nSpiriVerse operates a **deferred billing model** to support new Partners:\r\n\r\n- Subscription billing does **not** begin at the time of account creation.\r\n- Billing commences only after the Partner has received their **first payout** through the Platform.\r\n- This means Partners can set up their storefront, list products, and begin trading without upfront subscription costs.\r\n\r\n### Billing Requirements\r\n\r\n- **Saved payment method required**: Partners must have a valid payment card saved to their account. Payouts are blocked until a payment card is on file.\r\n- **Automatic charges**: Subscription fees are automatically charged to the Partner's saved payment method on the billing date.\r\n- **Billing history**: Partners can view their full billing history, including past charges and upcoming billing dates, through their dashboard.\r\n\r\n### Discounts and Waivers\r\n\r\n- Platform administrators may apply **discount percentages** to a Partner's subscription at their discretion (e.g., promotional pricing, partnership arrangements).\r\n- Platform administrators may apply **payment waivers**, temporarily or permanently exempting a Partner from subscription fees.\r\n- Any discounts or waivers are applied at the sole discretion of [COMPANY_ENTITY] and may be revoked with notice.\r\n\r\n### Subscription Changes\r\n\r\n- Partners may switch between monthly and yearly billing through their account settings.\r\n- Changes take effect at the start of the next billing cycle.\r\n- No pro-rata refunds are issued for mid-cycle changes unless otherwise stated.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 7. Payout Terms and Schedules\r\n\r\n### Payout Method\r\n\r\n- Partner payouts are processed through **Stripe Connected Accounts**.\r\n- Funds are deposited directly into the bank account linked to the Partner's Stripe Connected Account.\r\n\r\n### Payout Prerequisites\r\n\r\nBefore a Partner can receive payouts, the following must be completed:\r\n\r\n1. **Stripe onboarding**: Full identity verification and account setup through Stripe.\r\n2. **Payment card on file**: A valid payment card must be saved to the Partner's SpiriVerse account.\r\n3. **Bank account linked**: A valid bank account must be connected through Stripe.\r\n\r\n### Payout Schedule\r\n\r\n- Payout schedules are managed by Stripe in accordance with Stripe's standard payout timelines for each market.\r\n- Typical payout timing varies by market:\r\n  - **Australia**: 2-3 business days\r\n  - **United Kingdom**: 2-3 business days\r\n  - **United States**: 2 business days\r\n- These timelines are indicative and subject to Stripe's processing schedules and any applicable holds.\r\n\r\n### Payout Tracking\r\n\r\n- Partners can track payout status through their SpiriVerse dashboard.\r\n- Webhook notifications (via Stripe's `payout.paid` event) confirm when payouts have been successfully deposited.\r\n- Payout details include the amount, date, and associated transactions.\r\n\r\n### Payout Deductions\r\n\r\n- Platform fees (Partner percentage and fixed fees) are deducted before payout settlement.\r\n- Refunds processed after payout may be deducted from subsequent payouts or charged to the Partner's saved payment method.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 8. Refund and Chargeback Handling\r\n\r\n### Refund Policy\r\n\r\nPartners are expected to maintain their own refund policies in compliance with local consumer protection laws. SpiriVerse facilitates refund processing through the following methods:\r\n\r\n| Refund Method | Description |\r\n|---------------|-------------|\r\n| **Original payment method** | Funds returned to the Customer's original payment card via Stripe. |\r\n| **Store credit** | Credit applied to the Customer's SpiriVerse account for future purchases. |\r\n| **Bank transfer** | Direct refund via bank transfer where applicable. |\r\n\r\n### Partial Refunds\r\n\r\n- Partial refunds are supported. Partners may refund a portion of the original transaction amount.\r\n- Partial refund amounts are at the Partner's discretion, subject to their stated refund policy and applicable consumer protection laws.\r\n\r\n### Platform Fee Handling on Refunds\r\n\r\n- **Platform Fees (both Customer and Partner portions) are non-refundable in all cases.** When a refund is issued, the product or service amount is returned to the Customer, but Platform Fees are retained by SpiriVerse.\r\n- Stripe's processing fees are generally non-refundable, consistent with Stripe's terms.\r\n\r\n### Chargebacks\r\n\r\n- A chargeback occurs when a Customer disputes a charge directly with their bank or card issuer.\r\n- When a chargeback is initiated, Stripe notifies SpiriVerse and the Partner.\r\n- **Partner responsibility**: Partners are responsible for providing evidence to contest chargebacks where appropriate.\r\n- **Chargeback fees**: Any chargeback fees imposed by Stripe or the card network are the Partner's responsibility.\r\n- SpiriVerse will assist Partners with the chargeback dispute process where possible but does not guarantee outcomes.\r\n- Repeated chargebacks may result in account review, holds, or suspension under Section 14.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 9. Failed Payment Procedures\r\n\r\n### Customer Payments\r\n\r\n- If a Customer's payment fails at checkout, the order is not processed. The Customer is notified and prompted to:\r\n  - Retry with the same payment method\r\n  - Use a different saved payment method\r\n  - Add a new payment method\r\n\r\n### Partner Subscription Payments\r\n\r\nIf a Partner's subscription payment fails:\r\n\r\n1. **First attempt fails**: The Partner is notified via email and in-app notification. A retry is attempted automatically.\r\n2. **Subsequent retries**: Stripe will retry the charge according to its retry schedule (typically up to 3 additional attempts over several days).\r\n3. **All retries fail**: The Partner's account may be flagged, and access to certain Platform features (including payouts) may be restricted until payment is resolved.\r\n4. **Continued non-payment**: Prolonged failure to maintain a valid payment method may result in account suspension.\r\n\r\n### Updating Payment Methods\r\n\r\n- Partners can update their saved payment method at any time through their account settings.\r\n- Customers can manage their saved payment methods through their account settings.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 10.
